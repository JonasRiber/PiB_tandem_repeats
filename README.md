# PiB_tandem_repeats
### By Jonas Riber JÃ¸rgensen

This is a project focussed on algorithms for recogizing repeating patterns in strings to find tandem repeats.


Jupyter notebooks:

  - **suffix_tree_construction.ipynb**  
  (majority of the project)  
  Contains the different version of suffix tree construction algorithmens along with 2 versions of the Stoye n Gusfield repeat search through a suffix tree. Along with experimentation and testing of these functions

  - **linear_tree_construction.ipynb**
  (final part of the project)
  Ukkonen implementation of the suffixtree construction (faster version). Followed by experimentation. This notebook also contains the comparison between the 2 construction methods, and combines the entire suffix tree workflow to compare with the naive algorithm.

  - **mccreight_tree_construction_NOT_COMPLETE.ipynb**
  McCreight implementation that partially works with some strings, and not with others. 

  
Additional scripts:  

  - **brute_force_tandem_repeats.py**  
  Finds all repeats within a string and how many times they repeat
  does so iteratively

  - **find_all_repeats.py**  
  Finds all tandem repeats within a given string. Does not find how many times a given tandem repeats repeats.
  Does this iteratively. 

  - **suffixtree_construction.py**  
  .py script version of the naive suffix tree construction from the suffix_tree_construction.ipynb notebook

  - **repeat_search_speedup.py**  
  Stoyeand Gusfield algorithm  
  .py script version of the repeats search algorithm from the suffix_tree_construction.ipynb notebook
